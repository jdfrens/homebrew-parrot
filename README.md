Homebrew tends to stay with stable versions of
(Parrot)[https://www.parrot.org/] (if it updates it at all), so I've
created this homebrew tap to stay up-to-date and also update with
developer versions as well.

## To Use

Add this tap to your homebrew:

    brew tap jdfrens/parrot

You only need to do this once.

To install parrot:

    brew install jdfrens/parrot/parrot
